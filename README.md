# commitment
This project creates an Android phone app to track weight loss progress and conditioning goals

There will eventually be two parts to this app - weight (loss) tracking and meeting conditioning commitments

Weight (loss) Tracking involves entering a weight for each day taken in the morning before showering.  
    There is a UI for entering the values.   
    The values are then stored in a file  (date and weight in lbs)
    The initial output can be done in Excel which opens the file and displays running 7 day averages
    This output can be built into the phone app later
    
Conditioning Commitment involves tracking the number of miles walked and the weight of the pack (0 means no pack).
      The commitment is to walkd at least 5 days a week with three of those being at least 6 miles with increasing pack weight (up to full pack)
      The data input will be added to the Weight tracking UI to include Miles walked and Pack Weight
